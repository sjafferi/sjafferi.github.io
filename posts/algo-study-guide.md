# What's in this guide

This is meant to be a comprehensive guide for mastering technical interviews on algorithms and data structures. It includes a ground up understanding of the theory (relying on MIT 6.00.1 and Sedgewick's Algorithms) as well as problems aggregated from books and the web. 

This guide assumes you have some background in algorithms and hence won't reiterate common definitions.

By the end of each section, you should have the tools necessary to come up with on the spot solutions to related problems.  

## Study Plan

The plan of attack for studying is as follows:

- Understand the underlying theory behind each data structure
  - Implementation, applications, complexities, traversals
- Study problems representative of the data structure
  - Core problems that can be used to derive solutions to many other problems
- Iterate until perfect
  - Use spaced repetition (linked Anki cards) to commit learnings to long term memory
